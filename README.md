# My First Game: Space Dodge (Age 10)

**Language:** Python with Pygame Zero

You control a spaceship (cyan rectangle) and dodge falling asteroids (gray circles). If you get hit—BOOM! Game over. 

It started as a super simple dodger, and I had plans to add more (like eggs!), but this is the original core I coded back then.

Now I'm bringing it back and evolving it with AI for the xAI Grokathon: an **Adaptive NPC Engine** where NPCs remember, gossip, adapt, and grow. 🚀

## How to Run
1. Install Pygame Zero (one-time):
   ```bash
   pip install pgzero

   pgzrun space_game.py
